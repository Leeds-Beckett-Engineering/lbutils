# Library Examples for `lbutils`

## Overview

This is a collection of examples, utility classes and other scraps of code which demonstrate the use of the `lbutils` library in common applications. Many of these examples will require extension, or further development in real applications. However they should give some idea of what those more complete applications may look like.

## Demonstrations

Many of the examples require a working board to reproduce, and so where possible examples have been provided on [WokWi](https://wokwi.com/).

Current demonstrations are

- `lbutils.drivers.seven_segment.SegDisplay`: [7-Segment 
Display](https://wokwi.com/projects/360451068863047681)
- `lbutils.drivers.seven_segment_hex.SegHexDisplay`: [7-Segment Hex Digits Display](https://wokwi.com/projects/360462223276690433)

## Tested Implementations

This version is written for MicroPython 3.4, and has been tested on:

- Raspberry Pi Pico H/W
