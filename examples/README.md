# Library Examples for `lbutils`

## Overview

This is a collection of examples, utility classes and other scraps of code which
demonstrate the use of the `lbutils` library in common applications. Many of these
examples will require extension, or further development in real applications.
However they should give some idea of what those more complete applications may
look like.

- `drivers`. Collection of driver modules. e.g. for seven segment displays
- `pmod`. Examples and sample applications for the drivers of the
[Digilent peripheral modules](https://digilent.com/reference/pmod/start)
provided by the library.

## Tested Implementations

This version is written for MicroPython 3.4, and has been tested on:
