# Library Examples for `lbutils`

## Overview

Many of the examples require a working board to reproduce, and so where possible examples have been provided on [WokWi](https://wokwi.com/).

Current examples are

- `seven_segment_example.py`. Example of using the `lbutils.drivers.SegDisplay`
driver for a seven-segment display, requiring seven GPIO pins. A complete example
is available at [WokWi](https://wokwi.com/projects/360451068863047681), which is
based on the same driver code.
- `seven_segment_hex_example.py`. Example of using the
`lbutils.drivers.SegHexDisplay` driver for a seven-segment display, requiring
seven GPIO pins. A complete example is available at [WokWi]
(https://wokwi.com/projects/360462223276690433), which is based on the same driver
code.

## Tested Implementations

This version is written for MicroPython 3.4, and has been tested on:
