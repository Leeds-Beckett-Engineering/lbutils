"""Tests of the `colours` module: mostly the colour conversion routines of the
`Colour` class.

!!! Note     Binary strings are used in the checks of the bit values to make it
easier     to locate stray and incorrect bits. If a test fails, `pytest` should
report the correct binary representation, and the one recieved from the method.

Run as: `py.test test_colours.py`
