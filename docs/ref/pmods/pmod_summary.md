# Pmod Drivers

## Current Support

This library provides utilities and drivers designed to support for the Digilent
Peripheral Modules. This library is designed to provide drivers and support for
the [Digilent peripheral modules](https://digilent.com/reference/pmod/start).
Not all boards are supported: and in some cases only certain busses are
supported (e.g. using only the I2C bus, even though the `pmod` supports both I2C
and SPI).

## SPI Conventions

!!! note "Modern SPI Name in Use"
     For this module, and all SPI references in the library, the [modern SPI
     names](https://www.oshwa.org/a-resolution-to-redefine-spi-signal-names/) are in
     use. However, most  of the PMod reference documentation (and the underlying
     hardware devices) still use the older terms.

**Figure 1: Modern Naming Conventions for the SPI Interfaces [CC0 â€“ Public Domain]**

In general each module will require a minimum of four pins for the SPI
interface, as shown in Figure 1. For the SPI modes in the [PMod Interface
Specification Version
1.2.0](https://digilent.com/reference/_media/reference/pmod/pmod-interface-
specification-1_2_0.pdf) at least two pins are additionally required for +3.3V
(Pins 6 and 12) and 0V (Pin 5 and 11). This means that for most PMods using the
12-pin SPI jumper interface, the following basic pattern will hold (numbers
refer to the default GPIO pin assignment for the Pico H/W on the Leeds Beckett
micro-controller development board)
